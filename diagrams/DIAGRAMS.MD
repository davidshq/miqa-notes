# Diagrams

## Tooling
The included diagrams have been created using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) and can be edited using the same.

## Included Diagrams
- `miqa-store.drawio` - This is the most fleshed out diagram, it includes functional (sequence) flow within the MIQA Vuex store.
- `miqa-frame-sfc.drawio` - Provides a view of the components, props, data, and Vuex store flow within the `<Frame>` component.
- `miqa-store-components.drawio` - This shows the flow from individual components to the Vuex store.
	- NOTE: Initially attempted to include this view within the main `miqa-store` diagram but things became much too cluttered.
- `miqa-components-hierarchy.drawio` - Displays the hierarchy of Vue components in MIQA.
	- NOTE: The first tab displays with `<UserAvatar>`, the second without. This makes the second tab much less cluttered.
- `miqa-experiments-sfc.draw` - Displays the functions operative in the `ExperimentsView` component.
