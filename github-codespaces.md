1. Create a new codespace on a fork of MIQA.
2. Follow directions in dev/README.md
3. Open in VSC.
    - The redirection from Django to Vue doesn't work unless the codespace is running from VSC in which case it can use the localhost address.
    - Note: While a project could be created using the simple-scans images there is an error loading the images. You can however upload and view local images.
