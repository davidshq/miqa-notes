- [vtkDataSet](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/api/Common_DataModel_DataSet.html) - "In vtk a dataset consists of a structure (geometry and topology) and attribute data. The structure is defined implicitly or explicitly as a collection of cells. The geometry of the structure is contained in point coordinates plus the cell interpolation functions. The topology of the dataset structure is defined by cell types and how the cells share their defining points."
- Proxies - See pg. 10 and following in [ParaView Scripting with Python](https://itk.org/Wiki/images/f/f9/Servermanager2.pdf). [Refactoring Guru's Proxy article](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/proxy) is also helpful.
    - Thus when one sees something like `View2DProxy` one can read it as "a Proxy for the View2D object".
